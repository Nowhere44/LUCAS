Who is Jean-Luc Mélenchon ?</h1>

<h2 class="mb-2 text-red-600 text-xl">BY LUCAS RINKCHBACH</h2>


<p class="font-bold mt-10 text-white">
  
  <p class="mb-4 font-bold text-white">  
Jean-Luc Mélenchon is a political figure and member of the Socialist Party, a left-wing political party.
    He comes straight from Morocco, born in Tangier, son of parents who work in French Algeria.</p>
<p class="mb-4 font-bold text-white">  
He ended up going to school and in particular the high school in Lons-Le-Saunier, he continued his studies in Besançon in the Doubs and obtained a Licence in philosophy and modern letters.
He has small jobs at the same time as his studies and then worked in the national education system. Then he is part of several associations, becomes an activist and many others. This is how his political career began.</p>
<p class="mb-4 font-bold text-white">  
Jean-Luc Mélenchon wants to establish a Sixth Republic with the project of strengthening democracy and the public sector within society. Stop nuclear power plants and hold a new assembly. Then he wants to change the health sector by removing supplemental health insurance, rebuilding the public hospital service and an environmental health plan. By abolishing mutuals, he wants to integrate them into social security.
From an ethical point of view, he wants to establish the right to die with dignity (with assistance), to establish guaranteed access to palliative care.</p>
<p class="mb-4 font-bold text-white">  
Besides that he wants to legalize cannabis, better control food production and fight against bad food.
This character offers us a lot of pretty unrealistic things, but also we can see from his appearances in public that he has trouble keeping his composure and therefore we see a character reacting hot and is in a certain way hysterical. With each appearance in public he allows himself what no one will allow himself and to this day the tantrums and insults he offers us on the screen are a real slip for his probable citizens. The citizens tell us that they do not want someone unstable and who comes from Besançon who leads for them. Because according to our surveys on the internet, the place of study of a candidate is important for them.
